# html-refactor-horiseon
ASU Bootcamp Challenge 1, Refactoring a demo website

One goal of the project was to organize the css of the website to have it be more efficient in regard to both readability and function.
Through a reduction of redundancy and addition of proper semantic tags, it will be easier to identify and make changes if necessary.
A second goal was to ensure that the html of the website is appropriately accessible and functional.
This was achieved through addition of alt text for images, as well as ensuring working links and a functional title.

The website can be located at the following:
